# RandomQuoteGenerator 
This code generates random quotes at the request of the user via refreshing the page directly or pressing the refresh button.
There is a random number generator which gives a result number which is not bigger than the number of the quotes in the array.
It then reads that number quote and displays it. There is also an automatic refresher every 10 seconds which is just enough to read a quote.
Every time the page refreshes the color of the background chanages to one of the few selected colors.
